## Building
By default, FoxLib has a dependency on FSharp.Core.dll, which you can grab by installing the F# tools in Visual Studio or by installing it from NuGet. If you would prefer not to have to reference FSharp.Core, you can compile FoxLib as a standalone library. To do this, compile it with the flag --standalone. Official releases will be built this way.
